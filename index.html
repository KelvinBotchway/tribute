              <h3 id="heading"><u>Illness and Death</u></h3>
              <p id="para1">
                Mills died on 24 July 2012 at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra, three days after his 68th birthday.
                Though the cause of death was not immediately released, he had been suffering from throat cancer and
                 had recently been to the US for medical reasons. Announcing his death, his office noted that he 
                 died hours after being taken ill,but a presidential aide said that he had complained of pains the
                  day prior to his death. However, Mills' brother, Dr. Cadman Mills later disclosed during the graveside
                   service that he had died from complications of a massive hemorrhagic stroke resulting from brain aneurysm.
                    According to the BBC, his voice had degenerated in the previous few months. 
                   Former minister Elizabeth Ohene said that as a result of previous false reports of his death, she had not
                    believed initial claims of his actual death. "For the past three or four years, there's been news he's
                     been unwell and rumours of his death – twice – and he appeared with grim humour to say they were 
                     exaggerated, insisting he was well." His vice president John Dramani Mahama was sworn in at
                      about 20:00 GMT on the same day. In accordance with Ghana's constitution, Mahama's tenure expired'
                       at the same time Mills' was due to end, by the end of the year just prior to an election,
                        in which he was due to run. Mahama said upon being inaugurated in parliament:

                This is the saddest day in our nation's history. Tears have engulfed our nation and we are deeply 
                saddened and distraught. I never imagined that one day that it would place our nation in such a
                 difficult circumstance. I'm personally devastated, I've lost a father, I've lost a friend,
                  I've lost a mentor and a senior comrade. Ghana is united in grief at this time for our departed president.
